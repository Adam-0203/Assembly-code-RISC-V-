# Assembly Projects

This repository contains **assembly code experiments** to explore low-level computing concepts.  
It covers:

- Basic manipulations: registers, memory, arithmetic, and logic operations.  
- Classic algorithms: sorting, matrix multiplication, and more.  
- Organized by project: each major task has its own folder for clarity and modularity.  

The goal is to **grasp low-level abstractions in computer science** and understand how high-level operations translate to assembly instructions.
